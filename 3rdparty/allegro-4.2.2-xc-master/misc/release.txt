Wrapping up Allegro How-TO. Based on the 4.2.1 release.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following steps must be done under Linux. Make sure you have the
necessary software installed.

1. Update your local SVN copy:

   svn up

   Look over file tree and remove any temporary files.

2. Create ChangeLog:

   First, find out the revision of the previous release, for example:

   svn ls https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/tags
   svn info https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/tags/v4-2-0

   Then generate a log of changes since then:

   svn log -r HEAD:5477 > ChangeLog
   sed -i -re'/-+$/d;s/r[0-9]+ \| ([^ ]+).*/<li>\n\1/;/^$/d;s/([A-Z].*)/  \1/' ChangeLog

   Use the generated ChangeLog file to update the docs/changes._tx
   and docs/thanks._tx files. Remove the ChangeLog file after use or
   move it to some other place.

3. Commit docs/changes._tx and docs/thanks._tx to the SVN repository.

4. Update the DLL symbol definitions:

   *only* for WIP releases: rm misc/dllsyms.lst
   chmod +x misc/fixdll.sh [problem in the CVS repository]
   misc/fixdll.sh --update-symbol-list

5. Commit misc/dllsyms.lst to the SVN repository.

6. In the allegro root directory, run `python misc/genexamp.py'. If the
   output looks good, applye the output adding ` | patch -p0' to the
   previous command and commit docs/src/allegro._tx.
   
7. Tag SVN repository:
    svn cp https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/branches/4.2 https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/alleg/allegro/tags/v4-2-1

* NOTE: svn doesn't retain timestamps when you use svn up or svn co.  IMHO it's
    best for files to keep the timestamp of the last change that was made in
    SVN -- a little bit of history.  You might want to do the next few steps
    from an `svn export'ed directory, which does preserve timestamps.

8. Set the locale to en_US or en_UK:

   export LC_ALL=en_US

9. Fix version number: 'misc/fixver.sh 4 2 1'

10. Make sure demo.dat is present in the 'demo' sub-directory.

11. Make sure the working directory is called 'allegro'.

12. Make sure the installed version of GNU autoconf is the right one.

13. Make .zip distro. Have the previous archive in parent directory.
    You will need to have the dat tool in your path.

    misc/zipup.sh all421.zip all420.zip
    
    The generated zip archive will be in the .dist subdirectory.

14. Make Unix distros. From the top level directory:

    cd .dist
    unzip all421.zip allegro/misc
    allegro/misc/mkunixdists.sh all421.zip
   
15. Check that the RPM file can be installed and compiled without problems.
    Also check if the patch applies ok (all421_diff.zip). To verify that the
    RPM .spec file is updated, you can build the package on a RedHat system,
    which verifies if the .spec file includes all the files of the package.
    You can use SourceForge's compile farm to do this, they have Red Hat
    Linux 9 running Linux 2.4 kernel on x86 architecture.

16. Use misc/zipwin.sh to make Windows binary distro. This script must
    be run under djgpp Bash having MSVC installed.
    If you do not have these installed, create a new windows binary
    distro based on the old one, update all text files and scripts and
    update the dlls with some you make with MinGW using the newly
    created .zip distro. (all421.zip)

17. Upload all packages to Sourceforge using the FRS (File Release
    System). Use CHANGES as the basis for the release notes.

18. Announce the new release to the Allegro mailinglist:
    <alleg-main@lists.sourceforge.net>, make sure you add URLs to both the
    Allegro homepage and the Allegro sourceforge download page.
    Also include the release notes and anything else you wish to add.

19. Convert local files back to Unix format, bump version number,
    and commit changed files.
    
    ./fix.sh unix --dtou
    misc/fixver.sh 4 2 2 SVN
    svn commit -m "Bumped version to 4.2.2 (SVN)"

20. Webmasters watch the mailing lists for annoucements and then update
    the web pages accordingly. If you are interested in this process
    yourself, you are free to do it following the instructions at:
