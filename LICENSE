Allegro 4 (the giftware license)
Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in cooperation, 
and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify, redistribute, and 
generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not have to give us 
anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a 
return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing an add-on 
package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the library, 
or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can 
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using it, 
it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but you are 
not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
